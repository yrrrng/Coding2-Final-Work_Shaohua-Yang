"I tried to find something interesting to relieve the anxiety inside me". Anxiety is often hidden in the noisy darkness and once you find it and drag it into the spotlight and blow on it hard, it will drift into the air like the seeds of a dandelion.

When we drive the machine to operate, these troubles will also float into the air.
